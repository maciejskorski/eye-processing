          Cognitive pupillometry is the measurement of pupil size to investigate cognitive processes such as attention, mental effort, working memory, and many others. Currently, there is no commonly agreed-upon methodology for conducting cognitive-pupillometry experiments, and approaches vary widely between research groups and even between different experiments from the same group. This lack of consensus makes it difficult to know which factors to consider when conducting a cognitive-pupillometry experiment. Here we provide a comprehensive, hands-on guide to methods in cognitive pupillometry, with a focus on trial-based experiments in which the measure of interest is the task-evoked pupil response to a stimulus. We cover all methodological aspects of cognitive pupillometry: experimental design; preprocessing of pupil-size data; and statistical techniques to deal with multiple comparisons when testing pupil-size data. In addition, we provide code and toolboxes (in Python) for preprocessing and statistical analysis, and we illustrate all aspects of the proposed workflow through an example experiment and example scripts.},
